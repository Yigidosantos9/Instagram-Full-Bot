# Instagram-Full-Bot
An Instagram bot that can login multiple accounts at the same time and follows users, likes and comments on posts, changes the profile, and most amazingly, automatically creates and posts Reels videos at specific intervals throughout the day.

## Description 
Developed an Instagram bot that automatically creates and posts reels videos at specific intervals throughout the day. This bot, written in Python, handles user login, selects a random image (whether AI-generated or not), and overlays it on an existing video. The bot then posts the video with trending hastags. Video editing and posting are done using MoviePy and PIL libraries.
